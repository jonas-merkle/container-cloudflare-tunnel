## Introduction

Cloudflare Tunnel provides a secure way to expose a web server running on your local network to the public internet. This can be particularly useful for development, accessing internal services remotely, or securely publishing a service without opening ports on your router. The container in this project sets up a Cloudflare Tunnel, making it simple to deploy.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

This setup assumes that [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) is the DNS provider for your domain.

### Environment Variables

Add the missing information for the environment variables in the `.env` file:

```env
CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN=''
```

- `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN`: This token is provided by Cloudflare when you create a new tunnel. Replace `''` with your actual token.

#### How to Obtain the Cloudflare Tunnel Token

To get the Cloudflare Tunnel token, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/).
2. Navigate to the **Zero Trust** section or **Access** section (depending on the Cloudflare interface).
3. Select **Tunnels** from the navigation menu.
4. Click on **Create a Tunnel**.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to name your tunnel and select your desired configuration.
6. Once the tunnel is created, Cloudflare will provide a **Tunnel Token**. Copy this token and paste it into the `.env` file under `CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN`.

Make sure to edit the `.env` file and add your specific token:

```bash
nano .env
```

To prevent `.env` from being tracked by version control, run the following command:

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged .env
```

### Hosts Configuration

Modify the `hosts` file if needed to define any custom hostname mappings:

```bash
nano config/hosts
```

Add any additional hosts that need to be mapped within the container. To avoid tracking changes to this file, run:

```bash
git update-index --assume-unchanged config/hosts
```

## Usage

### Starting the Container

To start the Cloudflare Tunnel container, run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command will start the container in detached mode.

### Stopping the Container

To stop the running container, use:

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Viewing Logs

To view the logs for the running container, which can help with troubleshooting:

```bash
docker logs cloudflare-tunnel
```

### Cleanup

If you want to remove all containers, networks, and associated volumes:

```bash
docker compose down --volumes --remove-orphans
```

## Real-World Examples

If you're looking for a step-by-step guide on how to use Cloudflare Tunnel in a real-world scenario, check out these blog posts:

### Example 1: Hosting a Webpage with Apache and Docker

By [John Wuller (@2br-2b)](https://github.com/2br-2b):

[**How to Host a Webpage Locally Using Cloudflare Tunnels, Apache, and Docker**](https://codegito.xyz/2024/12/01/cloudflare-apache-docker/)

In this tutorial, John demonstrates based on this repository:

- Setting up a local webpage with Apache and Docker.
- Configuring a Cloudflare Tunnel to securely expose the webpage to the internet without requiring port forwarding.

### Example 2: Secure Self-Hosting with Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnels

By [Sven van Ginkel](https://medium.com/@svenvanginkel):

[**Self-Hosting Securely with Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnels**](https://medium.com/@svenvanginkel/self-hosting-securely-with-cloudflare-zero-trust-tunnels-0a9169378f78)

In this guide, Sven explains the fundamental concepts of Cloudflare Zero Trust Tunnels and provides an in-depth walkthrough of the setup process on Cloudflareâ€™s side. While his Docker Compose configuration is not based on this repository, the core principles remain similar.

## Security Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that `.env` files are not shared or tracked in version control, as they may contain sensitive information such as API tokens or credentials.
- **Sensitive Files**: Always keep sensitive files like `.env` secure and ensure they are not exposed publicly.
